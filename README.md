## Data

The raw data files are quite large and thus will not be included as part of this repo. This project will assume that all data files will be downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation/data) and kept in the `./data/` folder.

At a glance, the available data describe customer's credit cards and the purchases they have made over several months. More description about the data can be found [here](./COMPETITION.md#Data)
